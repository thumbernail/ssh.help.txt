# Multiplay Game Server SDK
## Overview
[Multiplay](https://unity.com/products/multiplay) is Unity's scalable game server hosting platform.

The Multiplay Game Server SDK contains all of the functionality necessary to integrate your game server with Multiplay.

For additional information, please refer to the official [Multiplay Documentaion](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay).
## Prerequisites
This plugin supports the following versions of Unreal Engine:
* 4.22
* 4.23
* 4.24
* 4.25
* 4.26
* 4.27
* 5.0

If you have a compatible version of Unreal Engine then you can skip ahead to the [plugin installation instructions](#install-the-plugin).

If you do not already have Unreal Engine installed, please read the following instructions on how to obtain Unreal Engine.

There are two methods of obtaining Unreal Engine, [building the engine from source](#building-the-engine-from-source) or [installing a pre-built binary using the Epic Games launcher](#installing-the-engine-using-the-launcher).

### Build the Engine from Source
Please perform the following steps in order to build the engine from source:
1. [Create an Epic Games account](https://www.epicgames.com/id/register).
2. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join).
3. [Link your Epic Games account to Github account](https://www.epicgames.com/account/connected).
4. Clone the [Unreal Engine source code](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) using GIT.
5. Checkout a branch corresponding to one of the engine versions specified above, i.e. `4.27`.
6. Follow the `Getting up and running` instructions in the `README.md` file for the version of the engine that you have checked out.

At this point you should have an Unreal Engine binary that can be used to create a project and [install](#install-the-plugin) the plugin.

### Install the Engine Using the Epic Games Launcher
Please perform the following steps in order to install the engine using the Epic Games launcher:
#### Windows
1. Create an Epic Games account.
2. Install the [Epic Games launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/download).
3. Navigate to the `Unreal Engine` tab in the Epic Games launcher and install one of the engine versions of the specified above.
4. Install Visual Studio 2019.
    * Make sure the Game Development with C++ workload is checked. 
    * Under the Installation Details section on the right, also choose the following components:
        * C++ profiling tools
        * C++ AddressSanitizer (optional)
        * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362 or newer)
        * Unreal Engine Installer

At this point you should have an Unreal Engine binary that can be used to create a project and [install](#install-the-plugin) the plugin.
#### macOS
1. Create an Epic Games account.
2. Install the [Epic Games launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/download).
3. Navigate to the `Unreal Engine` tab in the Epic Games launcher and install one of the engine versions of the specified above.
4. Install Xcode.

At this point you should have an Unreal Engine binary that can be used to create a project and [install](#install-the-plugin) the plugin.
#### Linux
A binary installer for Linux is not provided, it is necessary to [build the engine from source](#build-the-engine-from-source).

## Install the Plugin
1. Download the Multiplay Game Server SDK plugin.
2. Create a `Plugins` directory in the root directory of your project.
3. Copy the *Multiplay Game Server SDK* into the `Plugins` directory.
4. Launch your `.uproject`.
5. Navigate to `Edit > Plugins > Project > Other` and verify that the *Multiplay Game Server SDK* plugin is enabled.

![Image showing the Multiplay SDK properly installed and enabled.](./Images/InstalledPlugin.png)
## Configuration
To utilize the *Multiplay Game Server SDK*, the `server.json` file must be properly configured.

The `server.json` file is a configuration file generated by Multiplay.

The `server.json` file contains information about the game server instance, such as the IP address, port, and server ID.

The *Multiplay Game Server SDK* needs to read the `$$query_port$$` variable and the `$$serverid$$` variable from the `server.json` file.

The `$$query_port$$` variable defines the port at which you can access the query protocol data.

The `$$serverid$$` variable defines the unique identifier for the server instance.

The `server.json` file is configured in the `Multiplayer > Multiplay > Build Configurations` section of the [Unity dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/).

Whether you are creating a new build configuration or editing an existing build configuration, the `server.json` file is configured at the `Configuration variables` step.

The `server.json` file for your title should look like the following:

```json
    {
     "queryPort": "$$query_port$$",
     "serverID": "$$serverid$$"
    }
```

See [server.json](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/server-json-file.html) and [configuration variables](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/configuration-variables.html) for additional documentation.
## Multiplay Game Server Lifecycle 
A game server hosted on Multiplay goes through the following stages:
### 1. *Server Start*
An instance of a game server binary is started.
### 2. *Server Allocation*
After an allocation request is sent from a matchmaker, Multiplay's API does arithmetic to determine which server to allocate for the match. 
If a server is determined to be the right fit for the request, it will be allocated.
The *Multiplay Game Server SDK* notifies a game server instance that it has been allocated using the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnAllocate` multi-cast delegate.
See [Allocation Flow](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/allocation-flow.html) for additional information. 
### 3. *Ready For Players*
When the server is ready to start accepting connections, the server can be marked as "Ready for Players" and clients can begin to connect to the game server. 
A game server instance can indicate that it's ready for players by invoking the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::ReadyServerForPlayers()` method.
### 4. *Unready For Players*
When the server is no longer ready for oncoming connections, the server can be marked as "Unready for Players" and clients can no longer join the game server.
A game server instance can indicate that it's unready for players by invoking the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::UnreadyServer()` method.
### 5. *Server Deallocation*
When the matchmaker has determined that the game server is ready to be reused, the matchmaker sends a deallocation request to Multiplay.
The game server will be returned to the pool of available servers.
The *Multiplay Game Server SDK* notifies a game server instance that it has been deallocated using the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnDeallocate` multi-cast delegate.
See [Deallocation Flow](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/deallocation-flow.html) for additional information. 

See [Allocations](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/customer-onboarding-topics/allocations.html) for additional documentation.
## Server Query Protocol (SQP)
[Server Query Protocol (SQP)](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/customer-onboarding-topics/game-server-query-protocols.html) is a protocol that facilitates querying information from a game server instance.

Multiplay uses the information supplied by the game server query protocol to detect unresponsive game servers and to create live dashboards of analytic data.

The *Multiplay Game Server SDK* contains a complete implementation of SQP, the game server's only responsibility is populating the data that is transmitted by SQP.

The game server is responsible for populating the following variables:
- `BuildId` - Contains the version number or build ID of the server.
- `CurrentPlayers` - Contains the number of players on the server.
- `GameType` - Contains the type of game on the server.
- `Map` - Contains the map the server currently has loaded.
- `MaxPlayers` - Contains the maximum number of players the server supports.
- `Port` - Contains the game port the server has exposed.
- `ServerName` - Contains the name of the server.

## C++ Integration
*Make sure the Multiplay Game Server SDK plugin is properly installed before proceeding.*

Add `MultiplayGameServerSDK` as a dependency of your module.
```cpp
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "MultiplayGameServerSDK" });
```
Include the plugin header files you wish to access in your own classes. 
```cpp
#include "MultiplayServerConfigSubsystem.h"
#include "MultiplayGameServerSubsystem.h"
#include "MultiplayQueryHandlerSubsystem.h"
```
### UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem
This subsystem is responsible for retrieving the server configuration for the current session.

This subsystem reads the `server.json` file and exposes its values via the `FMultiplayServerConfig` struct.

`FMultiplayServerConfig` contains the following values:
* The server ID.
* The allocation ID.
* The Server Query Protocol Port.
* The connection port for the session.
* The directory logs will be written to.

`UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem` automatically reads the `server.json` file on subsystem initialization.

#### How to Access `UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem`
First we must obtain a reference to the subsystem, `UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem` is a `UGameInstanceSubsystem` and can be retrieved from `UGameInstance`.
```cpp
UWorld* GameWorld = GetWorld();
UGameInstance* GameInstance = GameWorld->GetGameInstance();
UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem* ServerConfigSubsystem = GameInstance->GetSubsystem<UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem>();
```

#### GetServerConfig
After we have obtained a reference to the subsystem, `FMultiplayServerConfig` can be retrieved using `UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem::GetServerConfig()`.

For example:
```cpp
const FMultiplayServerConfig& ServerConfig = ServerConfigSubsystem->GetServerConfig();
UE_LOG(YourLogCategory, Log, TEXT("Server ID: %lld Allocation ID: %s Server Query Port: %u Port: %u Server Log Directory: %s"), ServerConfig.ServerId, *ServerConfig.AllocationId, ServerConfig.QueryPort, ServerConfig.Port, *ServerConfig.ServerLogDirectory)
```

### UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem

#### How to Access `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem`
First we must obtain a reference to the subsystem, `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem` is a `UGameInstanceSubsystem` and can be retrieved from `UGameInstance`.
```cpp
UWorld* GameWorld = GetWorld();
UGameInstance* GameInstance = GameWorld->GetGameInstance();
UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem* GameServerSubsystem = GameInstance->GetSubsystem<UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem>();
```

#### SubscribeToServerEvents
Once we obtain a reference to the subsystem, we must establish a connection between the game server instance and the SDK daemon.

`UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::SubscribeToServerEvents()` is the method that is used to establish a connection between the game server instance and the SDK daemon.

The SDK daemon transmits events to the game server indicating when the game server has been allocated and when the game server has been deallocated.
```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->SubscribeToServerEvents();
```

#### OnAllocate
The game server instance must wait for a notification from the SDK daemon indicating that the server has been allocated.

This notification is transmitted using the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnAllocate` dynamic multi-cast delegate.

Any setup logic should be executed within the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnAllocate` callback. 

The `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnAllocate` delegate will return an instance of `FMultiplayAllocation`. 

`FMultiplayAllocation` contains the following data:
* The event ID for the allocation.
* The server ID for the allocation.
* The ID for the allocation.

How to add the callback:
```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->OnAllocate.AddDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnAllocate);
```

How to remove the callback:
```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->OnAllocate.RemoveDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnAllocate);
```

Example callback:
```cpp
void UMyClass::OnAllocate(FMultiplayAllocation Allocation)
{
    // Here is where you handle the allocation.
    // This is highly dependent on your game, however this would typically be some sort of setup process.
    // Whereby, you spawn NPCs, setup the map, log to a file, or otherwise prepare for players.
    // Once you the allocation has been handled, you can then call ReadyServerForPlayers()!

    UE_LOG(YourLogCategory, Log, TEXT("Event ID: %s Server ID: %lld Allocation ID: %s"), *Allocation.EventId, Allocation.ServerId, *Allocation.AllocationId);
}
```

**NOTE**: `UMyClass::OnAllocate` must be a `UFUNCTION`.

#### ReadyServerForPlayers
After the game server has been allocated, the game server should use `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::ReadyServerForPlayers()` to indicate that it's ready to accept players. Readiness is the server's way of saying it is ready for players to join the server.
You must wait until you have been allocated before you can call `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::ReadyServerForPlayers()`.

```cpp
void UMyClass::OnAllocate(FMultiplayAllocation Allocation)
{
    // Perform setup logic.

    FReadyServerSuccessDelegate OnSuccess;
    FReadyServerFailureDelegate OnFailure;

    OnSuccess.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnReadyServerSuccess);
    OnFailure.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnReadyServerFailure);
    
    GameServerSubsystem->ReadyServerForPlayers(OnSuccess, OnFailure);
}
```

#### GetPayloadAllocation

If the game server was allocated with an accompanying [payload](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/allocations-payload.html) then the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::GetPayloadAllocation()` API can be used to retrieve the payload.

The allocation payload can be used to store up 10 KB of data that should be associated with this gameplay session.

If you are using [Unity Matchmaker](https://unity.com/products/matchmaker) then the allocation payload should be fetched in order to obtain [`MatchProperties` and the initial backfill ticket ID](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/integrations-and-tools.html#Allocati).

```cpp
void UMyClass::OnAllocate(FMultiplayAllocation Allocation)
{
    // Perform setup logic.

    FPayloadAllocationSuccessDelegate OnSuccess;
    FPayloadAllocationFailureDelegate OnFailure;

    OnSuccess.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnPayloadAllocationSuccess);
    OnFailure.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnPayloadAllocationFailure);
    
    GameServerSubsystem->GetPayloadAllocation(OnSuccess, OnFailure);
}
```

#### GetPayloadToken

The `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::GetPayloadToken()` API can be used to retrieves the JWT token associated to a specific allocation's fleet

```cpp
void UMyClass::OnAllocate(FMultiplayAllocation Allocation)
{
    // Perform setup logic.

    FPayloadTokenSuccessDelegate OnSuccess;
    FPayloadTokenFailureDelegate OnFailure;

    OnSuccess.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnPayloadTokenSuccess);
    OnFailure.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnPayloadTokenFailure);
    
    GameServerSubsystem->GetPayloadToken(OnSuccess, OnFailure);
}
```

#### UnreadyServer
Unready the server. 
This is to indicate that the server is in some condition which means it cannot accept players.
For example, after a game has ended and you need to reset the server to prepare for a new match.

We can use the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::UnreadyServer()` method to communicate this to Multiplay.

```cpp
FUnreadyServerSuccessDelegate OnSuccess;
FUnreadyServerFailureDelegate OnFailure;

OnSuccess.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnUnreadyServerSuccess);
OnFailure.BindDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnUnreadyServerFailure);

GameServerSubsystem->UnreadyServer(OnSuccess, OnFailure);
```

#### OnDeallocate
When a running sever is shutting down, Multiplay may deallocate the server. 

If there is any last minute cleanup or bookkeeping needed we can subscribe to the `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnDeallocate` dynamic multi-cast delegate in order to perform last minute operations.

The `UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::OnDeallocate` delegate will return an instance of `FMultiplayDeallocation`. 

`FMultiplayDeallocation` contains the following data:
* The event ID for the deallocation.
* The server ID for the deallocation.
* The ID for the deallocation.

How to add the callback:
```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->OnDeallocate.AddDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnDeallocate);
```

How to remove the callback:
```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->OnDeallocate.RemoveDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnDeallocate);
```

Example callback:
```cpp
void UMyClass::OnDeallocate(FMultiplayDeallocation Deallocation)
{
    // Here is where you handle the deallocation.
    // This is highly dependent on your game, however this would typically be some sort of teardown process.
    // You might want to deactivate unnecessary NPCs, log to a file, or perform any other cleanup actions.

    UE_LOG(YourLogCategory, Log, TEXT("Event ID: %s Server ID: %lld Allocation ID: %s"), *Deallocation.EventId, Deallocation.EventId, *Deallocation.AllocationId);
}
```

**NOTE**: `UMyClass::OnDeallocate` must be a `UFUNCTION`.

#### UnsubscribeToServerEvents
`UMultiplayGameServerSubsystem::UnsubscribeToServerEvents()` is the method that is used to cleanup the connection between the game server instance and the SDK daemon.

```cpp
GameServerSubsystem->UnsubscribeToServerEvents();
```

### UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem
The `UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem` is used to provide the relevant information for the servers SQP protocol.
To use the `UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem` we must first retrieve it using the following.

#### Retrieving UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem
```cpp
UWorld* GameWorld = GetWorld();
UGameInstance* GameInstance = GameWorld->GetGameInstance();
UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem* ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem = GameInstance->GetSubsystem<UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem>();
```
After retrieving the subsystem we must first ensure all our values are configured using the calls below.

#### IncrementCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of atomically increasing the current number of players whenever a player joins the match:
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->IncrementCurrentPlayers();
```
#### DecrementCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of atomically decreasing the current number of players whenever a player leaves the match:
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->DecrementCurrentPlayers();
```
#### SetCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of setting the current number of players:
```cpp
UWorld* GameWorld = GetWorld();
AGameStateBase* GameState = GameWorld->GetGameState();
int32 NumCurrentPlayers = GameState->PlayerArray.Num();
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetCurrentPlayers(NumCurrentPlayers);
```
#### SetMaxPlayers
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetMaxPlayers(64);
```
#### SetServerName
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetServerName(TEXT("AwesomeServer"));
```
#### SetGameType
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetGameType(TEXT("SearchAndDestroy"));
```
#### SetBuildId
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetBuildId(TEXT("NewBuildId.123.0.1"));
```
#### SetMap
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetMap(TEXT("MAP_TD_Dusthill"));
```
#### SetPort
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->SetPort(8080);
```
Make sure to continuously update these values as they are bound to change for the duration of the game. 
This will ensure Multiplay collects and displays accurate data while the server is running.
Once all the values are set, we can make a call to `Connect()`.

#### Connect
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->Connect();
```
If at any point we want to access the values we set we can use the accessor calls below.

#### GetCurrentPlayers
```cpp
int32 CurrentPlayers = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetCurrentPlayers();
```
#### GetMaxPlayers
```cpp
int32 MaxPlayers = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetMaxPlayers();
```
#### GetServerName
```cpp
FString ServerName = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetServerName();
```
#### GetGameType
```cpp
FString GameType = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetGameType();
```
#### GetBuildId
```cpp
FString BuildId = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetBuildId();
```
#### GetMap
```cpp
FString Map = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetMap();
```
#### GetPort
```cpp
int32 Port = ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->GetPort();
```
#### Disconnect
Before server shutdown, ensure to run the `Disconnect()` function.
```cpp
ServerQueryHandlerSubsystem->Disconnect();
```
## Blueprint Integration
*Make sure the Multiplay Game Server SDK plugin is properly installed before proceeding.*

### Multiplay Server Config Subsystem
This subsystem contains the server configuration for the current session.

This subsystem retrieves this information from the `server.json` file on subsystem initialization.

The server configuration can be retrieved by placing a `UMultiplayServerConfigSubsystem` node and then accessing the `Server Config` variable.

`Server Config` contains the following values:
* The server ID.
* The allocation ID.
* The Server Query Protocol Port.
* The connection port for the session.
* The directory logs will be written to.

![GetServerConfig Blueprint example](./Images/BP_GetServerConfig.png)

### Multiplay Game Server Subsystem
This subsystem is responsible for notifying the game server when allocation and deallocation occur.

The game server uses this susbsystem to communicate when it's ready to accept players and when it is no longer ready to accept players.

#### OnAllocate
The game server is notified of an allocation by binding an event to the `OnAllocate` delegate.

Any game specific setup logic should occur after the event bound to `OnAllocate` is triggered.

The `OnAllocate` delegate returns an `FMultiplayAllocation` instance.

The `FMultiplayAllocation` instance contains the following values:
* The event ID for the allocation.
* The server ID for the allocation.
* The ID for the allocation.

![OnAllocate Blueprint example](./Images/BP_OnAllocate.png)

#### OnDeallocate
The game server is notified of a deallocation by binding an event to the `OnDeallocate` delegate.

The game server should use the `OnDeallocate` delegate to perform any game specific teardown logic.

The `OnDeallocate` delegate returns an `FMultiplayDeallocation` instance.

The `FMultiplayDeallocation` instance contains the following values:
* The event ID for the deallocation.
* The server ID for the deallocation.
* The ID for the deallocation.

![OnDeallocate Blueprint example](./Images/BP_OnDeallocate.png)

#### SubscribeToServerEvents
After binding both the `OnAllocate` delegate and `OnDeallocate` delegate, the game server should invoke `SubscribeToServerEvents` to begin receiving allocation and deallocation notifications from the Multiplay SDK daemon.

![SubscribeToServerEvents Blueprint example](./Images/BP_SubscribeToServerEvents.png)

#### ReadyServerForPlayers
After receiving an allocation notification, and optionally performing any game specific setup logic, the game server can now indicate that it's ready to accept players by invoking `ReadyServerForPlayers`.

![ReadyServerForPlayers Blueprint example](./Images/BP_ReadyServerForPlayers.png)

#### GetPayloadAllocation
If the game server was allocated with an accompanying [payload](https://docs.unity.com/multiplay/shared/allocations-payload.html) then the `GetPayloadAllocation` node can be used to retrieve the payload.

The allocation payload can be used to store up 10 KB of data that should be associated with this gameplay session.

If you are using [Unity Matchmaker](https://unity.com/products/matchmaker) then the allocation payload should be fetched in order to obtain [`MatchProperties` and the initial backfill ticket ID](https://docs.unity.com/matchmaker/integrations-and-tools.html#Allocati).

![GetPayloadAllocation Blueprint example](./Images/BP_GetPayloadAllocation.png)

#### GetPayloadToken
The `GetPayloadToken` node can be used to retrieves the JWT token associated to a specific allocation's fleet

![GetPayloadToken Blueprint example](./Images/BP_GetPayloadToken.png)

#### UnreadyServer
If at any point the state of the match changes to where we don't want to accept new players (Match nearing end, match ended and switching maps, etc.) Then we can use the `UnreadyServer` Blueprint to communicate this to Multiplay.

![UnreadyServer Blueprint example](./Images/BP_UnreadyServer.png)

#### UnsubscribeToServerEvents
`UnsubscribeToServerEvents` is the node that is used to cleanup the connection between the game server instance and the SDK daemon.

![UnsubscribeToServerEvents Blueprint example](./Images/BP_UnsubscribeToServerEvents.png)
### Multiplay Server Query Handler Subsystem
`UMultiplayServerQueryHandlerSubsystem` is used to provide the relevant information for the servers SQP protocol.
To use the subsystem we must first configure all our values for the server using the Blueprints below.
#### IncrementCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of atomically increasing the current number of players whenever a player joins the match:
![IncrementCurrentPlayers Blueprint example](./Images/BP_IncrementCurrentPlayers.png)
#### DecrementCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of atomically decreasing the current number of players whenever a player leaves the match:
![DecrementCurrentPlayers Blueprint example](./Images/BP_DecrementCurrentPlayers.png)
#### SetCurrentPlayers
This API provides a means of setting the current number of players:
![SetCurrentPlayers Blueprint example](./Images/BP_SetCurrentPlayers.png)

Make sure to continuously update these values as they are bound to change for the duration of the game. 
This will ensure Multiplay collects and displays accurate data while the server is running.
Once all the values are set, we can add in the `Connect` Blueprint.
#### Connect
![Connect Blueprint example](./Images/BP_Connect.png)

If at any point we want to access the values we set we can use the accessor Blueprints below.
#### GetCurrentPlayers
